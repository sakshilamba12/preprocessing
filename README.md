# Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing, which are critical steps in any data analysis or machine learning pipeline. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy), I worked on a raw dataset to identify and fix data quality issues like missing values, duplicates, incorrect data types, and outliers.

# Objective

To clean and prepare the raw dataset for further analysis or modeling by applying standard preprocessing techniques and improving overall data quality.

# Tools and Technologies
Python
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook
Raw data source: archive (2).zip

# Steps Performed
Loading the Data
Read raw data from CSV
Initial Exploration
Basic statistics, shape, and data types
Handling Missing Values
Dropping or imputing nulls where appropriate
Removing Duplicates
Identified and dropped duplicate records
Data Type Conversion
Corrected data types for consistency
Outlier Detection & Treatment
Used boxplots or IQR methods to detect and handle outliers
Data Formatting
Cleaned column names, standardized string values, etc.
Saving the Cleaned Data
Exported the cleaned dataset for future use
